'''
Hash maps and hash sets are important for coding interviews.
When you see the words 'unique', 'count', 'frequency' in a coding question, most probably a hash map or a hash set can be used to solve the problem. 

Remember:
Set: only contains keys and is unique
Map: Contains key and value pairs and is unique

Benefit of a hash map:
- Constant time read, write

Cons of hashmap:
- Hash maps are not ordered. In order key traversal is not gauranteed.
